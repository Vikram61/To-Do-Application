This is a simple and interactive Todo List app built using React. I made this project to practice React concepts like components, props, hooks (useState, useEffect), and also tried adding some cool animations using Framer Motion.

The app lets you:

✅ Add tasks

✅ Mark them as complete

✅ Delete tasks

✅ Tasks stay saved even if you refresh (thanks to localStorage!)

✅ Includes dark theme styling with smooth transitions and hover effects
